# Project: Emotions Word Game
This project is about developing a simple game with win or lose feature using Javascript. The game chosen is called "Emotions Word Game". 

# Description 
1. The theme of this game is "emotions" and uses words describing various emotions from The Feeling Wheel developed by Dr. Gloria Willcox. She adapted the wheel from the original version developed by Dr. Robert Plutchik.
2. Words that describe emotions can vary from broad level e.g. anger, sadness, to very specific ones e.g. disrespected, isolated. 
3. As such, they could be used in words matching games that involve categories (broad level) and elements belong to the categories (specific level).

# How to play 
1. The player will be shown random words and a category. 
2. The player has to select all the words that match the category.
3. Once a match is successful, the player will be shown another category and has to select all the words that belong to the category. 
4. The player will aim to match as many as possible within the time given. 
5. The player only has 3 tries for wrong matches.

# Why this game
In the book titled "How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain" by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, she states the importance of emotional granularity in developing emotional intelligence. Being able to accurately label our emotions and help us to better understand, regulate and communicate them. Studies have shown that people with more vocabulary describing their emotions i.e. emotional granularity are better equipped to handle adversity. This game aims to make it easier for everyone to remember more granular emotions and hopefully use them in our day to day to help us understand our emotions better.
